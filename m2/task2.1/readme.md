# Task 2.1
## Answering the questions
### The most popular hypervisors are Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation and KVM. I used VirtualBox in this task. 
### I have expirience of usage VirtualBox and VMWare Workstation. VMWare is more configurable, it has a lot of features that can be flexibly customized, but VirtualBox is more suitable for users with no expirience and can be used for student learning.
